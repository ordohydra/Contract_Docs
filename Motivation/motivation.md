# Motivation

In my day-to-day development practice, I’ve noticed a few common patterns that many teams tend to follow:

Almost everything is defined as a protocol (or abstract interface) to provide better separation between abstractions and concrete implementations.
Many core features of object-oriented programming (like inheritance) are rarely used in practice.
This led me to rethink how programs are structured — focusing on contracts and their implementations, rather than traditional OOP paradigms. I began exploring programming languages that support protocol-oriented programming without relying on OOP. Surprisingly, I couldn't find any that truly embraced this approach.

Another concern I’ve encountered is that modern general-purpose languages often include a large number of features — some seemingly added for marketing purposes — which increase complexity without providing practical benefits. That’s why I’ve started working on a programming language designed around a minimal set of essential concepts, focusing on clarity and simplicity rather than optimization.

Languages that inspired me:
- Swift
- Dart
- Kotlin
- Go
- Python
